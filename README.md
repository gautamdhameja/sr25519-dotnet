# sr25519-dotnet

.Net bindings for SR25519 crypto implemented using P/Invoke on a `dll` generated by compiling Rust code as `cdylib`.

The underlying Rust code compiled into `dll` is from the SR26619 C bindings [https://github.com/Warchant/sr25519-crust](https://github.com/Warchant/sr25519-crust). The original Rust implementation of SR25519 crypto, on which these bindings are built, is available at [w3f/schnorrkel](https://github.com/w3f/schnorrkel).

Well, yeah, we can call these bindings on bindings. :-)

The current code uses release builds on various platforms from the C bindings compatible with version v0.9.1 of schnorrkel (builds from master https://github.com/Warchant/sr25519-crust/commit/ddbabcd12cbe60a7921e280ad93476faf4d4212a).

Test data used here is the same as that in the [C bindings](https://github.com/Warchant/sr25519-crust) to ensure things are working as expected.

## Usage

All SR25519 operations (currently supported) are in the `SR25519.cs` class. Simply call any of the functions like:

```csharp
var keys = SR25519.GenerateKeypairFromSeed(
                "8fd6aabb4e4c06826efcf0d0a46b2580ca7bad1b419a49c92b49717b30bc343e");
```

Check the [tests](./sr25519-dotnet.test/SR25519_Tests.cs) for more examples.

## Current State

At the moment, these bindings don't include VRF signing and verification functions.

The native lib dependency is also provided for various platforms in the `/native/libs` folder:
- Windows 64-bit (MSVC)
- MaxOS 64-bit
- Android (Linux) ARMv8 & x86_64
- Linux x86_64

## To Do

* ~~Update to latest version of schnorrkel when C bindings are updated.~~
* Add bindings for VRF related functions.
* Automate build process.
* Publish as a nuget package.
